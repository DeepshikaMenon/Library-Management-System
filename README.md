# Library-Management-System
> OVERVIEW :

Library Management System is a software, which is used to record the details of books available in the library. You can perform different functions on those books. It is dynamic in nature. Here, you can take input from user regarding the functions to be performed on the books as well as regarding the library and it's details. To build this software we have used java programming language, as for the structure of code MVC Architecture has been followed. Let me give a short brief idea about MVC Architecture.

> Model View Controller (MVC) Architecture -

MVC stands for Model View Controller.
It is a software architecture pattern commonly used in designing and development of application. Particularly, in context with desktop application and web application.
It is a way to organise and structure code to enhance maintainability, modularity and scalability.
 1. Model : In Model, we will be storing Entities and Data Logic will be provided through getters and setters.
 2. View : It acts as User Interface, which can take input from User and provide output.
 3. Controller : Controller consists of Business Logic.

> Key Features :

A. Menu Driven - The software is menu driven. A menu driven program makes it easy for the user to use the software. Here, we have provided a particular menu to perform functions on the books and the menu is as follows

   Select option to perform
   1. Add book
   2. Remove book
   3. Update book
   4. Get book
   5. Exit

B. User Friendly - The software is user friendly. It takes input from the user, whether it be regarding the library details or about the functions to be performed on the books as follows

Enter name of library : National Library

6. Click on Java Downloads, there you will get different Java Development Kit (JDK) versions.
7. Select the latest JDK version, also select the device which you are using.
8. Click on the appropriate download link, which will download a zip file.
9. After that, extract the zip file and install JDK to your device.

B. Steps to install Eclipse IDE -

1. Go to the browaser.
2. Search for Eclipse.
3. Click on Download.
4. It will install a zip file.
5. Then extract the zip file and install Eclipse to your device
   
> Use Case:

You can execute the software either using command prompt or IDE. For executing the software via command prompt you might need any editor like Notepad, EditPlus, etc. For executing via IDE you may need any IDE like Eclipse IDE, VS Code, etc. I have used Eclipse IDE to create the software. Let us take a real world scenario, to understand better the functioning of the software as follows
